# UX/UI Design Context for Commercial Property Assessment Mobile App Prototype

## Project Purpose & Scope
This is a HIGH-FIDELITY MOBILE WIREFRAME/PROTOTYPE for a commercial property assessment mobile app. This is NOT a production application - it's purely for:
- Stakeholder demonstrations and presentations
- User experience testing and validation
- Visual design exploration and iteration
- Concept validation before actual mobile app development

## Design Philosophy & Approach

### Mobile-First UX Principles
- Touch-first interaction design with minimum 44px touch targets
- Progressive disclosure to reduce cognitive load on mobile screens
- Clear visual hierarchy with appropriate typography scaling
- Contextual micro-interactions and meaningful animations
- Accessibility-first approach (contrast, screen readers, motor accessibility)

### Commercial Property Assessment Context
- Designed for field inspectors working on-site at commercial properties
- Optimized for outdoor/varying lighting conditions (high contrast design)
- Form flows should minimize input errors and maximize completion rates
- Consider inspectors wearing gloves or working in challenging conditions
- Progressive form filling with logical grouping and conditional fields

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Component Design Standards
- Use DaisyUI components as base, customize for mobile-specific needs
- Implement custom mobile interactions (drawers, bottom sheets, gestures)
- Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate loading/pressed states
- Use CSS transitions for smooth, performant animations (avoid JS animations when possible)
- Implement proper focus management for accessibility

### Form UX Best Practices
- Group related fields logically with clear visual separation
- Use progressive disclosure - show fields only when relevant
- Implement inline validation with clear, helpful error messages
- Provide clear visual feedback for all user actions
- Consider offline states and data persistence (even in prototype)

### Visual Design Consistency
- Maintain consistent spacing using Tailwind's scale (4px increments)
- Use semantic color system from DaisyUI with custom property assessment theme
- Typography hierarchy should support scanning and quick reading
- Icons should be clear at mobile sizes and support the assessment context

## Development Workflow

### Prototyping Iterations
- Build complete user flows, not just isolated screens
- Create multiple states (empty, loading, error, success) for each screen
- Test on actual mobile devices, not just browser dev tools
- Document UX decisions and rationale for stakeholder presentations

### Stakeholder Presentation Considerations
- Build smooth transitions between screens for demo flow
- Include realistic data and content (property types, addresses, etc.)
- Consider adding "tour mode" or guided walkthrough capabilities
- Ensure prototype works reliably during presentations

## Content & Data Guidelines

### Realistic Property Assessment Data
- Use actual commercial property types and assessment criteria
- Include realistic address data and property information
- Consider regional differences in property assessment requirements
- Use professional, clear language appropriate for field inspectors

### Accessibility & Inclusivity
- Design for varying levels of technical expertise among inspectors
- Consider multilingual support needs for diverse inspector teams
- Ensure design works for users with vision, motor, or cognitive differences
- Test with actual property assessment professionals when possible

## File Organization & Naming

### Component Structure
- Keep mobile-specific components in dedicated folders
- Name components clearly (e.g., PropertyAssessmentForm, MobileDrawer)
- Separate presentation components from business logic
- Create reusable form field components for consistency

### Design System Approach
- Document design tokens and component variations
- Create a style guide within the prototype for handoff
- Maintain consistency in spacing, colors, and typography
- Build components that can easily translate to React Native later

Remember: This prototype's primary goal is to validate UX concepts and demonstrate the user experience to stakeholders. Prioritize user experience over technical complexity.
